//! \brief
//! Manages the various IO streams of an ML C++ process.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! ML C++ processes that can be run from Java can take input from
//! and send output to:
//! 1) STDIN/STDOUT
//! 2) Standard files on disk
//! 3) Named pipes
//!
//! Option (3) will be used in production, but the others are useful
//! for backwards compatibility and testing.
//!
//! Additionally, state persistence and restoration can be via
//! named pipes.
//!
//! This class:
//! 1) Is the single point from which the appropriate C++ stream for
//!    a given function can be retrieved.
//! 2) Manages the lifecycle for streams other than STDIN/STDOUT.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Input/output streams are returned as references because they are
//! always required.  Persist/restore streams are returned as pointers
//! because some processes may not require both.
//!
